# MyWork
 
The first one Chatroom is a coursework I did by myself. It is a single page web
application written in AngularJs and using MongoDB as the database. 

The second one is a group project i worked with my friend, as we do not like the 
UI of the lihkg, so we re-designed the UI.

The third one is my fyp, which I worked with my teammate to build a wikipedia for chinese 
characters and words. This platform allows user freely input any chinese characters and
words or anythings related to them, ie story or image.
